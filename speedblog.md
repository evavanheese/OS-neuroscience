# Speed Blog: Open Science Guidebook for Neuroscience

## Meet the Team
Hoiiii! :wave: We are the [Open Science Working Group](https://anatomy-neurosciences.com/initiatives/openscience/) at Amsterdam UMC's Anatomy and Neuroscience Department, a diverse team of neuroscientist, including Ph.D. researchers, postdocs, research assistants, and technicians, all united by our passion for advancing the field. Our aim is to promote and implement Open Science practices within research departments focusing on Neurosciences.

## Project background
Our project seeks to **create a tailored Open Science Guidebook for Neuroscience**, addressing knowledge gaps hindering open science practices. The guidebook will offer step-by-step guidance on data management, pre-registration, protocol sharing, analysis code sharing, and open-access publishing. Uniquely designed for the diverse subfields of neuroscience, it consolidates existing resources and introduces new content to address specific challenges. Accessible to researchers at all levels, it aims to empower students, early-career scientists, and professionals, fostering collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency within the neuroscience community. 

## Our process in OLS
Participating in the OLS-8 program, our expectations centered on acquiring comprehensive knowledge and skills for developing the project such ours. 

## Key understanding and accomplishments
We aimed to learn the intricacies of curating and consolidating resources, creating tailored content, and enhancing accessibility for effective dissemination. Additionally, we anticipated gaining insights into project design with multiple collaborators, and identifying suitable platforms for project outreach. Furthermore, we hoped to grasp strategies for sustainable and accessible project management, collaboration techniques, and attracting external contributors.

### What elements helped you get there? 
Thanks to our bi-weekly mentor meetings and participation in OLS-8 calls, we've gained invaluable insights, particularly in the realms of licensing and data sharing. We've also acquired skills in crafting webpages from GitHub repositories, developing a Code of Conduct, and creating contributing files. The knowledge gained in Leadership and Community Engagement has proven instrumental in enhancing our project performance. These learning experiences have not only been enriching but have significantly contributed to our project's success. 
   
However, we faced a series of challenges, encompassing the need to navigate busy schedules, assimilate new knowledge and put it into practice, and struggle with difficulties initiating and designing the project while ensuring effective coordination among all team members.

## The main goals achieved in this project 
1. We created an overview of the chapter of the Guidelines
2. We create a GitHub repository for the project
3. We set 2h writing sessions every 2 weeks.

## Next steps
The immediate focus is on **officially launching the project**, incorporating all chapters by including relevant text, figures, and graphical material to enhance accessibility. Disseminating the content within our department and beyond is a crucial mid-term objective. Looking further ahead, we aspire to cultivate a community that actively contributes to maintaining and updating the guidebook's content, ensuring long-term sustainability and relevance.

### Staying connected
Yes! We want to stay connected with the OLS community  open.science.anw@amsterdamumc.nl 
_Do you plan to stay in touch with the OLS community or other members? If yes, how do you think you can do that?_

:sparkles: We would like to express our gratitude to our mentor, Siobhan Hall, for guiding us through the process, providing feedback, and giving a broad perspective!
