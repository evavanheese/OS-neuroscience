# Speed Blog: Open Science Guidebook for Neuroscience

## Meet the Team
Hoiiii! We are the [Open Science Working Group](https://anatomy-neurosciences.com/initiatives/openscience/) at Amsterdam UMC's Anatomy and Neuroscience Department. We are a diverse team of neuroscientist, including Ph.D. researchers, postdocs, research assistants, and technicians, all united by our passion for advancing the field.  Our aim is to promote and implement Open Science (OS) practices within research departments focusing on Neurosciences. 

- Ideally your speed blog will be a written piece with a picture (max 2) and contain some links and references. In terms of word count you are aiming for between 500 and 1200 words.
- We will post your speedblog on OLS website: openlifesci.org/posts
- See this post for guidance on speed blogging: https://software.ac.uk/speed-blogging-and-tips-writing-speed-blog-post
- Example you can draw from: https://openlifesci.org/posts/2019/10/21/culture-track 

**Here are a few questions to help you generate ideas and content for your speedblog:**

## Project background
Our project seeks to **create a tailored Open Science Guidebook for Neuroscience**, addressing knowledge gaps hindering open science practices. The guidebook will offer step-by-step guidance on data management, pre-registration, protocol sharing, analysis code sharing, and open-access publishing. Uniquely designed for the diverse subfields of neuroscience, it consolidates existing resources and introduces new content to address specific challenges. Accessible to researchers at all levels, it aims to empower students, early-career scientists, and professionals, fostering collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency within the neuroscience community. 

## Expectations from this program  
Participating in the OLS-8 program, our expectations centered on acquiring comprehensive knowledge and skills for developing the project. We aimed to learn the intricacies of curating and consolidating resources, creating tailored content, and enhancing accessibility for effective dissemination. Additionally, we anticipated gaining insights into project design with multiple collaborators, understanding licensing and data sharing, and identifying suitable platforms for project outreach. Furthermore, we hoped to grasp strategies for sustainable and accessible project management, collaboration techniques, and attracting external contributors.

## Key understanding and accomplishments
### The initial steps 
_Starting out - what did you do to explore the problems / project?_

### What elements helped you get there? 
_Discussions, connections made, activities carried out, mentors consulted, other?_

We learn a lot about... 
1. Licesing and data sharing
2. Create webpages from GitHub repositories
3. Create a Code of Conduct and contributing file.
4. Learship and engagement
   
But we had to face some challenges!
1. Busy schedules
2. New knowledge assimilation
3. Difficulties to start and design the project and coordinate between all of us. 

## The main goals achieved in this project 
1. We created an overview of the chapter of the Guidelines
2. We create a GitHub repository for the project
3. We set 2h writing sessions every 2 weeks.

## Next steps
The immediate focus is on **officially launching the project**, incorporating all chapters by including relevant text, figures, and graphical material to enhance accessibility. Disseminating the content within our department and beyond is a crucial mid-term objective. Looking further ahead, we aspire to cultivate a community that actively contributes to maintaining and updating the guidebook's content, ensuring long-term sustainability and relevance.

### Staying connected
Yes! We want to stay connected with the OLS community  open.science.anw@amsterdamumc.nl 
_Do you plan to stay in touch with the OLS community or other members? If yes, how do you think you can do that?_
