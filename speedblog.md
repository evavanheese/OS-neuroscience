# Speed Blog: Open Science Guidebook for Neuroscience

## Meet the Team
Hoiiii! :wave: We are the [Open Science Working Group](https://anatomy-neurosciences.com/initiatives/openscience/) at Amsterdam UMC's Anatomy and Neuroscience Department, a diverse team of neuroscientists, including Ph.D. researchers, postdocs, research assistants, and technicians, all united by our passion for Open Science.

## Project background
Our project seeks to **create a tailored Open Science Guidebook for Neuroscience**, addressing knowledge gaps hindering open science practices. The guidebook will offer step-by-step guidance on data management, pre-registration, protocol sharing, analysis code sharing, and open-access publishing. Uniquely designed for the diverse subfields of neuroscience, it consolidates existing resources and introduces new content to address specific challenges. Accessible to researchers at all levels, it aims to empower students, early-career scientists, and professionals, fostering collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency within the neuroscience community. 

## Our process in OLS
Participating in the OLS-8 program, our expectations centered on acquiring comprehensive knowledge and skills for developing a project such ours. 

### Key understanding and accomplishments
We aimed to learn the intricacies of curating and consolidating resources, creating tailored content, and enhancing accessibility for effective dissemination. Additionally, we anticipated gaining insights into project design with multiple collaborators, and identifying suitable platforms for project outreach. Furthermore, we hoped to grasp strategies for sustainable and accessible project management, collaboration techniques, and attracting external contributors.

### What elements helped you get there? 
Thanks to our bi-weekly mentor meetings and participation in OLS-8 calls, we've gained invaluable insights, particularly in licensing and data sharing. We've also acquired skills in crafting webpages from GitHub repositories, developing a Code of Conduct, and creating contributing files. The knowledge gained in Leadership and Community Engagement has proven instrumental in enhancing our project performance. These learning experiences have not only been enriching but have significantly contributed to our project's success. 
   
However, we faced a series of challenges, encompassing the need to navigate busy schedules, assimilate new knowledge and put it into practice, and struggle with difficulties initiating and designing the project while ensuring effective coordination among all team members.

### The main goals achieved in this project 
1. üìã We put together a handy overview that breaks down the different chapters of the Guidelines, giving us a roadmap for the project.
2. üìÅ We organized by creating a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marbarrantescepas/OS-neuroscience) for the project. This helps us all work together smoothly, keeping track of changes and staying up-to-date.
3. ‚úíÔ∏è To keep things moving, we set up casual bi-weekly 2-hour writing sessions. It's a time for the team to get together and make progress on the project in a laid-back, collaborative way. 

## Next steps
The immediate focus is on **officially launching the project**, incorporating all chapters by including relevant text, figures, and graphical material to enhance accessibility. Disseminating the content within our department and beyond is a crucial mid-term objective. 

Looking further ahead, we aspire to cultivate a community that actively contributes to maintaining and updating the guidebook's content, ensuring long-term sustainability and relevance.

### Staying connected
üå± We would like to stay in contact with all the amazing people of the OLS community. We look forward to collaborating with fellow mentors and mentees to create a supportive environment where everyone can thrive and reach their full potential. We would like to hear from you, and we are looking forward to contributors, if you are interested, contact us via email open.science.anw@amsterdamumc.nl

:sparkles: Many, many thanks to our mentor, Siobhan Hall, for guiding us through the process, providing feedback, and giving a broad perspective!
