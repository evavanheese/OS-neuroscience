# Code of Conduct

We aim to foster a friendly and positive community environment and we welcome everyone that would like to participate. This code of conduct outlines our expectations of participants within the community, as well as the steps to report unacceptable behavior.

By participating in this community, participants agree: (1) to abide by this code of conduct, and (2) to ensure that participation in this project and its community is a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, gender identity or expression, disability, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, personal appearance, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, size, sexual orientation, family or socioeconomic status, or technical ability.

Any form of behaviour to discriminate, exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort, is a violation of the code of conduct. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

# Expectations of Community Participants

Be welcoming and friendly.

Be considerate: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.

Be patient and respectful: Not all of us will agree all the time and we're all likely to experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow frustration to turn into an attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

Be careful in the words that we choose: We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

- violent threats or language directed against another person
-  discriminatory jokes and language
- posting sexually explicit or violent material
-  posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”)
-  personal insults
-  unwelcome sexual attention
-  advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior
-  repeated harassment of others

In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

Try to understand why we disagree: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Diversity contributes to the strength of our community. Focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

# Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting [NAME] at [email]

All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

- your contact information
- names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved, and those of any witnesses
- your account of what occurred or is ongoing, including, if possible, links to any publicly available record
- any additional information that may be helpful

After filing a report, the incident will be reviewed, followed up with any additional questions, and a decision made as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
